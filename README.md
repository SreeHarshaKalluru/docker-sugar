# Sugar Docker Container


This is a basic docker container used to run Sugar.
It should work on GNU/Linux with X11 and pulseaudio.


### Installation

You need have Docker ready and launched

```sh
$ sh run.sh
```

### TODO

* Build a real development container with volume mounting and sugar building from sources
